## Technical Architecture
### Parsing Logic
1. **Splitting Clippings:** The `My Clippings.txt` file is split into individual clippings using the `==========` delimiter.
2. **Metadata Extraction:** Each clipping is parsed to extract:
   - Book title
   - Clipping type (highlight, note, or bookmark)
   - Date added
   - Highlight or note text
3. **Markdown Generation:** The parsed data is converted into Markdown with:
   - Book titles as headers (`#`)
   - Metadata as bold text (`** **`)
   - Highlights/notes as blockquotes (`> `)

### Error Handling
- Skips malformed clippings (e.g., missing metadata or text).
- Handles Unicode and special characters using `utf-8-sig` encoding.
